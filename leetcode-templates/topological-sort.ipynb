    "Topological sorting is a fun graph concept that can be applied to directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). To topologically sort a graph means to provide a linear sorting of the graph's vertices based on how the vertices are ordered in the DAG. Think of this like a dimensionality reduction technique that unravels a complicated network into one-dimention whose ordering preserves a minimal structure of the original network.\n",
    "\n",
    "To give you an example, a classic application if topological sorting is to find an order in which to take college classes while factoring in course prerequisites. Let's say you have to take 20 classes to complete your major, but many of those classes have to be taken in sequences (e.g. single variable calculus -> multivariable calculus -> differential equations). These 20 classes can be arranged into a DAG network. Notice that there are often many different ways in which we can arrange a valid sequence of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "One algorithm that we can use to produce a topological sorting is called Kahn's algorithm. Kahn's algorithm leverages the concept of indegrees. The indegree of a particular vertex in a DAG is defined as the count of the number of vertices directly pointing at that vertex (e.g. the number of direct prerequisites a class has). Kahn's algorithm works by maintaining the current indegree of every vertex in the graph. At each step in the sort, we process the vertices with indegrees of 0, meaning they have no prerequisites or all of their prerequisites have previously been processed, and append them to the sorting. In processing these vertices, we also decrement the indegree of any neighbor vertex the current vertex serves as a prerequisite for, thereby allowing us to search for the next set of vertices with indegrees of 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "Often times, LeetCode graph problems will not provide you with a graph data structure but rather will give you an array of edges expecting you to build the graph from this array. The set of edges is structured such that each pair `[vertex_a, vertex_b]` represents a directed edge that points from `vertex_a` to `vertex_b`. Before we can run Kahn's algorithm, we need to build a graph data structure that tells us what vertices each vertex serves as a prerequisite for. There are many choices for building such a data structure but usually the best choice in this context is an adjacency list. For this tutorial, whenever we have to build a graph from a set of edges, we will build an adjacency list in the form of a dictionary where the keys will represent the vertex index, and the values will be either a list or a set of vertex indices that the key is a prerequisite of. For example, for the adjacency list `{0:[1,2,3], 1:[3]}`, vertex `0` is prerequisite of vertices `1`, `2`, and `3`."

    "This questions asks us to figure out the minimum number of semesters it takes to complete all the college courses, given a list of course prerequisites. A course may not be taken until all of its preqrequisite courses are taken in prior semesters. The input `n` indicates that there are `n` courses labeled from `1` to `n`, and the input `relations` is an array such that `relations[i] = [prevCoursei, nextCoursei]` indicates `prevCoursei` is a prerequisite to taking `nextCoursei`.\n",

    "This question lends perfectly to our topological sorting template. We know we have `n` courses which we can think of as vertices in our graph, and we know we have an array `relations` which we can think of as a set of directed edges connecting our courses. To solve this problem, our goal will be to apply Kahn's algorithm to topologically sort the courses. We will make a small adjustment to our template as the goal of the problem is to find the number of semesters it takes to complete the topological sorting of courses. To track this, we will consider a semester to be the set of courses that currently have zero indegrees. For instance, the first semester we will process the courses that have no prerequisites at all. The second semester we will take the courses whose prerequisites were fulfilled by taking the first semester's set of courses. We repeat this loop until we run out of courses in our `zero_indegree_queue`.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this problem, we're given a list of words written in an alien language that uses the English alphabet. We don' know the correct order of the alien language letters (e.g. in English the order is `abcdef...`). We're told that the list of words is sorted lexicographically according to the sort order of the alien language's letters. Our task is to return a lexicographic sorting of the unique letters present in the list of words according to the alien language's rules. If it's impossible to do so we return an empty string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive in lets understand the problem. We want to return a lexicographic sorting of the alien language letters, but just of the letters present in our list of words. The letters within a word don't tell us anything about the relative order, we'll only be using the ordering of the words to deduce the ording of the letters. We know such a sorting will be impossible if we find a cycle in the list of words (e.g. if we see both `a` sorted before `b` at one point but also `b` sorted before `a`). As an example, if we were provided with the words `[’bbb’, ‘aaacdef’]` one possible answer we could return is `'bacdef'`. Note that letters inconsequential to the sorting (in this example `'cdef'`) can be returned in any order amongst themselves (e.g. `'bafedc'` is also a valid sorting).\n",

    "With this information we can start to see how topological sorting can help us. We know that if we take adjacent pairs of words in our list `words`, we can compare the words based on the first set of letters in which they differ to discover a sorting between that pair of letters. We can do this for every set of adjacent words to build out an adjacency list. Then we can run Kahn's algorithm. Really the only tricky part of this problem is building out the adjacency list."
