    "Backtracking is an understudied topic in my opinion when it comes to LeetCode interview questions. If you aren't comfortable with backtracking I highly recommend spending some time learning the algorithm as it can be used to solve a wide variety of questions as I will demonstrate in the examples section. At its core, backtracking is simply a special recursive form of Depth First Search (DFS). Like DFS, backtracking explores a path as deeply as possible before continuing along a new path. Unlike DFS however, backtracking keeps track of all values encountered along the current path as a candidate solution, typically in some kind of container data structure. Also unlike DFS, as soon as the algorithm determines the current candidate cannot lead to a valid solution it will \"backtrack\" by abandoning the last encountered value along the current path (e.g. popping the last value from a list) and then vist the next path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Backtracking is used to solve Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs), which are questions that define a set of objects and ask you to manipulate the objects in a way that satisfies a set of constraints. A classic backtracking example is [N-Queens](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-queens/) which asks you to place `n` queens on an `n x n` chessboard such that no two queens attack each other. Your object in this case is the chessboard, your constraint is that no two queens can attack each other, and a container object you could use to record a solution is a list with tuple coordinate pairs of successfully placed queens (e.g. queens placed on (0,0) and (1,2): `[(0,0), (1,2)]`). A backtracking algorithm would solve this problem by attempting to place queens onto the chessboard until it has successfully place `n` queens. If it is unable to place a queen before reaching `n` placements, the algorithm has reached a deadend along the current path and must backtrack by removing the last placed queen (popping the last tuple coordinate in our list) and attempting to place it in a different spot.\n"

If however we get a modification of the problem where we're asked to find how many ways can we uniquely place queens onto the board and still satisfy the constraints, then you can't terminate the recursion early and must use the above template to check every possible combination of valid queen placements."

    "This problem asks us to find a word in a 2-dimensional array containing letters. Unlike in traditional word search, the word can \"snake\" as a 4-directional path through the grid. Upon first glance, you may think you can use BFS or DFS to solve this problem. However these algorithms don't work because they rely on maintaing an append only `visited` set whenever you visit a new grid cell. In our case however, if we realize our current candidate will not be able to build the target word, we need to backtrack, and upon backtracking we need to remove cells that are being backtracked from the `visited` set so we may possibly use them in a later path. Thus we use the backtracking algorithm for this problem."

    "This is my favorite interview problem that I've recieved in a FAANG interview. The problem asks us whether or not a given hand of 14 cards (enumerated 1-9, assume no suits) is a winning hand. A winning hand is one that contains 4 sets of triplets, where each triplet is a set of 3 cards that either form a run (e.g. 1,2,3) or are the same value (e.g. 1,1,1), and the remaining two cards are a pair (e.g. 2,2). \n",

    "The tricky part to this problem is figuring out how to build up our candidate solution. Instead of checking card by card, lets check 3 cards at a time, that way at each recursive step we check if we have a triplet run or three-of-a-kind, if we don't have either in any number 1-9 then we know we've hit a deadend and that we need to backtrack. Our base case as a result is when we're left with two cards, we just need to check if those two cards are a pair. An efficient way of building our candidate is to use a dictionary object where the key is the card and the value is the count of that card remaining in our hand. Rather than build up our candidate (our hand), in this example we actually subtract from it. "
