    "Breadth first search (BFS), also known as a level order traversal, is a graph traversal algorithm most often used in interviews to find the shortest path between two vertices in an unweighted graph. BFS questions are my favorite to recieve in interviews because the interview prompt almost always gives it away that you want to use a BFS by mentioning a word like \"shortest\" or \"least\" and because BFS is very straightforward to implement. Typically the only tricky part of a BFS is determining how to generate the current node's neighbors, although this is usually very obvious. In a 2-dimensional array for instance a grid cell's neighbors are most often the adjacent grid cells."

    "\n",
    "This is a classic LeetCode problem where you're given a 4 digit lock and are tasked with finding the least amount of lock turns needed to get from combo `'0000'` to `target` without hitting a combo in `deadends` along the way. A lock turn consists of turning one wheel by one slot e.g. `'0000'` -> `'0001'`. Digits consist of the numbers 0-9.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of this as an undirected graph problem where the vertices are valid lock combos and the edges connect lock combos that can be reached in one turn from one another. The fact that we are searching for the least number of lock turns tells us BFS is a great candidate for solving this problem since the first time we reach the `target` combo during our BFS traversal must be in the least number of turns.\n",

    "Walls and gates is another classic LeetCode problem where you're given a 2-dimensional array where values in the array represent walls (`-1`), gates (`0`), or empty rooms (`2**31 - 1`). Our task is to modify the input array in place by filling in each empty room with an integer representing the length of the path to the room's nearest gate.\n",

In this problem, paths to gates must be 4-directional (meaning a neighboring cell can be north, south, east, or west of the current cell, this is different from 8-directional where neighbors can additionally be north-east, north-west, south-east, south-west of the current cell).\n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind your first thought might be to traverse the array and run a BFS every time we encounter a gate. While this is a valid strategy it would result in running multiple BFS's. A more optimal way of solving this problem is instead traversing the entire array and recording the coordinates of every gate. We then run a single BFS using the prerecorded gate coordinates as the starting nodes in the 1st level of our BFS. This way we only need to run a BFS once!\n",
